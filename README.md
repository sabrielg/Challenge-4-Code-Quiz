## Description
This project was created so that a user can take a 5 question short quiz about chickens! The quiz has a sixty second timer that stops the quiz when it reaches zero. If the user gets an answer incorrect 5 seconds is taken off of the timer. At the end of the quiz a list of scores is displayed they are prompted to input their initials. Their score is then displayed at the bottom of the list.

This project utilizes JavaScript and local Storage. I learned how to traverse the DOM, use for loops, event listeners, and use JSON to parse and stringify.

## Usage

When the user clicks the link they are taken to the main page of the quiz:

When the user clicks the 'Start Quiz' button a timer starts and they are presented with a series of questions.

When the user has answered all of the questions or the time has run out the quiz ends and they are taken to the highscores page and prompted to input their initials.
